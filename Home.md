## Basics

Before you start implementing your own gadget, take your time to view some of the examples already in-game, as they're a great starting point for gadgets.

most importantly, they all follow very strict coding rules. [See Examples](https://github.com/copybugpaste/HomebrewAPI/tree/master/Examples)

We've also worked up a simple example on how you go about creating a custom Gadget, See [Tutorial](Tutorial)
